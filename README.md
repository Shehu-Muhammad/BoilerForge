## Git Integration

BoilerForge can initialize a Git repository when creating your project:

- bare â€“ Creates a bare repo without a working directory.

- template â€“ Uses a directory as a repo template.

- shared â€“ Allows multiple users to push to the same repo.

## Command Reference

| Command       | Description                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`      | Create a new project from a template.                     |
| `list`        | View all available templates.                             |
| `upgrade`     | Update templates from local repo or GitHub                |
| `initGitRepo` | Initialize a Git repository manually in a project folder. |
| `reset`       | Deletes one or all folders inside generated folder.       |

## Upgrade Command â€“ Detailed Usage

BoilerForge allows you to keep your templates up-to-date with the upgrade command. This ensures that any new improvements, bug fixes, or template updates are applied to your generated folder.

```bash
boilerforge upgrade
```

How It Works

1. Local First:

   - If you have a local templates/ folder in your project, BoilerForge will copy all templates from there into the generated/ folder.

   - This is useful if you are developing or modifying templates locally.

2. GitHub Fallback:

   - If no local templates are found, BoilerForge will fetch templates directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shehu-muhammad/BoilerForge).

   - This ensures your generated/ folder always has the latest templates even if you donâ€™t maintain a local copy.

3. Safety:

   - Existing projects in the generated/ folder are cleared before updating; this does not affect your actual project directories.

   - You will see console messages for every step, including success or any errors.

> Tip: Run `boilerforge upgrade` regularly to ensure you have the latest templates and fixes.

## Examples

Create a Node.js project with Git:
```bash
boilerforge create api-server --template node --git
```

Create a Flask project without Git:
```bash
boilerforge create my-flask-app --template flask --no-git
```

Create a bare Git repo from a template:
```bash
boilerforge create infra-setup --template node --git bare
```

Deletes a specific project in generated folder:
```bash
boilerforge reset test-node-1
```

Deletes all projects in generated folder:
```bash
boilerforge reset
```

Update templates in the generated folder from local repo or GitHub:
```bash
boilerforge upgrade
```
